The Push for EVs

There is support for electric vehicles in Virginia.

### Virginia

- [2018 Virginia Energy Plan](https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2018/october/headline-831605-en.html):
  From the governor's office, the plan describes how increasing the percentage
  of electric vehicles registered in Virginia (0.14% in 2017) can be a major
  driver for reducing CO2 emissions.
- [EVgo Charging Stations in Virginia](https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2018/august/headline-828389-en.html):
  Virginia is spending $14M of its share of the VW settlement money to contract
  EVgo to install DC fast chargers in Virginia.


### Charlottesville

- [Mini-Grants for EV Chargers](http://www.charlottesville.org/community/community-initiatives/a-green-city/sustainable-getting-around/mini-grant-ev-charger-network):
  The city created a grant to help subsidize the installation of publicly
  accessible EV chargers.
- [Riverbend Development](https://www.cvillepedia.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Riverbend_Development):
