### On Grounds EV Chargers

There aren't too many:

- Central Grounds Garage: 1 J-1772 L2 charger. $2.00.
- Darden Parking Garage: 3 NEMA 14-50 outlets. These spots require a D10EV
  parking permit.
- UVA Facilites has a few for their Nissan Leafs.

### Charging in Cville

EVgo is opening (has opened) locations in Charlottesville.

- Barracks Road Shopping Center
- Water Street Parking Garage

Tesla has a Supercharger at Stonefield.

There are three Greenlots chargers, two in downtown surface parking lots, and
one at a hotel off US-29. These units, however, are notoriously unreliable and
will probably not be repaired once they are broken.

Several businesses have free-to-use EV chargers in their parking lots.

Because I am an EV owner! I bought a Chevy Bolt in August 2018 and have been driving
it ever since.
