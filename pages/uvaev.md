### On Grounds EV Chargers

There aren't too many:

- Central Grounds Garage: 1 J-1772 L2 charger. $2.00.
- Darden Parking Garage: 3 NEMA 14-50 outlets. These spots require
  a D10EV parking permit.

### Charging in Cville

For a city its size, Charlottesville is pretty friendly for EV charging. There
are two DC fast chargers downtown, and more a short way up US-29 (including a
Tesla Supercharger). Several businesses have free-to-use EV chargers in their
parking lots.
