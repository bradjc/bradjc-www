I run in various non-profit footraces in Charlottesville.

Charlottesville Events
----------------------

The overall best event is the [Charlottesville Ten
Miler](http://www.cvilletenmiler.com/). The course traverses the city and the
route is lined with spectators. The "don't miss" event is the [Haven
8K](https://runsignup.com/Race/VA/Charlottesville/TheHaven8KRunforHome). The
breakfast afterwards is fantastic; tip: finish early and don't dawdle getting to
the Haven after finishing. The most beginner-friendly race is the [Community
Bridges 5K](https://runsignup.com/Race/VA/Charlottesville/CommunityBridges5K).
The [Pepsi 10k](http://www.pepsi10krun.com/) is popular and always has a strong
UVA presence. The [Big Brother Big Sisters
5K/10K](https://runsignup.com/Race/VA/Charlottesville/BigBrothersBigSistersVIRTUAL5K)
is very scenic and the two distances is a nice feature. The [Run For Autism
5K](https://runsignup.com/Race/Events/VA/Charlottesville/VIArun) has a nice
route through a neighborhood, but is pretty casual. The [4 Our Freedom
5K](https://runsignup.com/Race/Info/VA/Earlysville/4OurFreedom5K) is overtly
military themed and off-putting.
