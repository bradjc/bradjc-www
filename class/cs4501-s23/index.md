Overview
--------

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a computing platform where a large number of
_devices_ form a _network_ to monitor, control, and optimize some physical
system. To be scalable, these devices communicate _wirelessly_, both with each
other and to the Internet at large. But what wireless protocols do IoT devices
use? How do they work? And why are there so many? This course will provide a
hands-on introduction to the world of wireless in the Internet of Things. Over
the course of the semester we will explore what wireless options we have
available, how they differ and what the tradeoffs are, and how major IoT
wireless protocols work. We will also build networks of devices using real-world
wireless protocols.

We will look at WiFi, Classic Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, IEEE 802.15.4,
2G/3G/4G/5G cellular, LTE-M, NB-IoT, LoRa, and Z-Wave. We will also explore some
emerging wireless options, such as visible light communication (VLC), infrared
communication (IR), ultrasonic, wake-up radios, and backscatter.

individuals here who are ready and wanting to help. If you wish, you can make an
appointment with me and come to my office to talk in private.

Alternatively, there are also other University of Virginia resources available.

consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with
academic requirements. Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a
religious observance should submit their request in writing directly to me by
email as far in advance as possible. Students and instructors who have questions
or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious
beliefs may contact the University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil
Rights (EOCR) at UVAEOCR@virginia.edu or 434-924-3200. Accommodations do not
relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of the coursework
missed as the result of a religious observance.
