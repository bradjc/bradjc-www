plants easy to neglect

challenges
1. choosing a mcu
  - just claiming and getting a photon setup


easy
- arduino ide
- fritzing hardware layout program

hard
- hardware



Ashe
----

breathing sensing

motivation
- needed to be alittle broader
- current solutions not enough

learnings
- "once i found the correct object" it was very easy (TI RTOS that is)
- pthreads build on task structure, easier to use and more familiar
- difficult to setup, not clear dependencies required in configuring buffers
- visualization setup tools promised, then not implemented




Yang
----

classifying loads based on their power traces

motivation
- decent answers to my motivation questions
- good technical motivation

learnings
- conflict between printf and uart_send
  - using one prevents the other from working...weird
- ccs tools kinda helped, but breakpoints not great
- uart channel pretty easy to get setup


Nasir
-----

platform of gateways

motivation
- increased privacy
- gateways are isolated islands, difficult to develop applications
- heterogeneous gateways

learnings
- need better multiple hop support
- OTA updates would be great




Halier
-------

emotion collecting device

motivation
- hard to get data from people about mental health, people want to hide it
- anonymous feedback

learnings
- hard to figure out where things are executing in freertos
- toolchain issues like flashing


pretty nice story


Keshav
------

survey for edge computing operating systems

motivation
- latency of cloud computing
- repurpose local computing resources
- and we eventually got to privacy

learnings
- any?


Le & Yeprem
-----------

pairing devices conveniently

motivation
- need to pair devices
- want it to be easy for users

learnings
- hard to extract signal between events of sensor readings to generate keys
  - but i dont know the extent!!


matrix creator



Collins
-------

plant tracking for dryness

motivation
- people forget to water plants
- get experience on low power board

learnings
- difficult to do pin mappings in tinyos
- ble module support not complete
