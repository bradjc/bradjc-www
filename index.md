# My Research

Ubiquitous computing, the Internet of Things, wearable and implantable
technology, and smart homes/building/factories promise to bring billions of new
embedded devices online in the next decade. My research focuses on how to design
and build systems to ensure these devices are effective, unobtrusive, and
scalable. I ground my projects in real applications, spanning from more
efficient buildings to smarter cities to healthier individuals.

My work involves building real prototypes and demonstrating them at
reasonable scale. This systems approach includes building the hardware itself,
designing and deploying gateways that providing networking and services for the
embedded devices, and supporting the deployments with a cloud infrastructure for
processing and visualization.

**I'm looking for motivated EE/CpE/CS Ph.D. students to join my lab.** If you
are interested in building sensors, networking devices, deploying systems, or
designing better IoT systems, get in touch.
